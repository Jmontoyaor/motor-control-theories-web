        "\n",
        "        Esta teoría cuenta con un enfoque de control llamado FeedForward el cual prepara al cuerpo para adaptarse a las alteraciones del entorno y responder a estos cambios de forma adecuada minimizando el error. Pero al ser movimientos ejecutados rápidamente y sin pensar, si ocurre algún cambio espontáneo en el entorno resultará en un error en la ejecución.\n",

        "        * **Vulnerabilidad a Perturbaciones:** El sistema no puede corregir errores ni compensar disturbios externos. Si ocurre una falla o cambio en el entorno, el controlador no tiene forma de detectarlo y continuará operando desajustado.\n",

        "1. **Definición y Concepto General**\n",
        "La teoría de lazo cerrado se centra en el uso de la retroalimentación (feedback) para controlar el movimiento. Funciona como un GPS interno que verifica constantemente si el cuerpo sigue la trayectoria correcta y realiza ajustes en tiempo real. Los movimientos se controlan comparando el estado actual del sistema con un valor de referencia o estado deseado.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Componentes del Sistema**\n",
        "* **Mecanismo Efector:** Músculos esqueléticos, articulaciones y unidades motoras que ejecutan las órdenes del sistema nervioso central.\n",
        "* **Mecanismo de Retroalimentación:** Receptores sensoriales que detectan el estado real del movimiento.\n",
        "* **Mecanismo Comparador:** Contrasta la retroalimentación recibida con el objetivo del movimiento. Si existe discrepancia, genera una señal de error para iniciar acciones correctivas en el efector.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Tipos de Retroalimentación**\n",
        "* **Intrínseca:** Generada por receptores internos del cuerpo sobre posición, fuerza y movimiento.\n",
        "* **Extrínseca:** Proviene de fuentes externas, como instrucciones verbales de un fisioterapeuta o video de análisis de marcha.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Integración con el Movimiento y la APTA**\n",
        "Desde la perspectiva de la APTA y el análisis del movimiento como sistema complejo, la teoría de lazo cerrado es vital en la rehabilitación motora:\n",
        "* **Sistema Complejo:** El movimiento no depende de un solo comando, sino de la interacción de múltiples subsistemas (sensorial, muscular, ambiental). El lazo cerrado permite que estos subsistemas se autoorganicen mediante el ajuste continuo del error.\n",
        "* **Aplicación Clínica:** Un fisioterapeuta utiliza el lazo cerrado al proporcionar “pistas verbales” (retroalimentación aumentada) mientras el paciente utiliza su propiocepción para corregir su patrón de marcha en tiempo real.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Limitaciones de la Teoría**\n",
        "* **Velocidad:** No explica movimientos balísticos o muy rápidos (lanzamiento de béisbol, golpe de artes marciales), donde el feedback no puede ser procesado a tiempo para corregir la acción en curso.\n",
        "* **Complejidad:** Puede ser menos efectivo en movimientos que involucran múltiples articulaciones y grados de libertad simultáneos.\n",
        "* **Factores Cognitivos:** No considera plenamente el impacto de la motivación, el miedo o la atención en el control motor.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ejemplos de Aplicación**\n",
        "* **Fisioterapia y rehabilitación:** Un fisioterapeuta proporciona instrucciones verbales (retroalimentación extrínseca aumentada) para ayudar a un paciente a corregir su patrón de marcha, mientras el paciente utiliza su propia propiocepción (retroalimentación intrínseca) para realizar ajustes en tiempo real.\n",
        "* **Actividades cotidianas:** El uso de los músculos intrínsecos de la mano permite realizar tareas de alta precisión, como escribir con un bolígrafo o tocar un instrumento musical, ajustando la fuerza y posición mediante los receptores sensoriales.\n",
